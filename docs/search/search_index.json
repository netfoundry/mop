Once the download is complete, the image can now be used by the local user. 2 Setup a VCPE Gateway on the Azure stack @ 2.1 Create an Azure Stack Gateway in the NetFoundry Console @ Sign in to your NetFoundry organization; Navigate to the Gateways page and create a new Azure Stack gateway. Give it a name and location, then click the Create button; Take note of the registration key. You will need it to register the gateway later. 2.2 Launch a NetFoundry Gateway Instance Inside of Your Azure Stack @ Sign in to your account on the Azure portal and go to \u2192 Resource groups. Once inside the resource group, Click the \"+ Add\" button on the toolbar. Search for \" Application Connection Gateway (Azure Stack)\". Click on the result, the description should be shown. Click the \"Create\" button to launch the wizard. Enter basics information: Enter the Username as \"nfadmin\". Important The username must be nfadmin to gain access to this gateway; ( the username restriction will be removed soon ) Click OK to continue Next page, on choosing the compute size, it varies depends on your need. We are using a 2 VCPUs and 4 GB RAM for this example. Continue to finish setup and let system bring up the VM. 2.3 Register the gateway with your NetFoundry Network @ Once the resource is created, go to the resource group & click on the virtual machine name to view the details. Locate the machine's public IP address. Using an SSH client, log in to the machine using its public IP address as the user \"nfadmin\", using the SSH key or password specified earlier. > ssh -i [path/to/private/key] nfadmin@[public_ip_address] What to do if you cannot login to the VM? It has been discovered that when using some version of Azure Stack (i.e. 1.1908.0.20) that after launching the VM, the user must reset the SSH key via the Azure console. This is accomplished by selecting the newly created VM and clicking \"reset password\" in the bottom left hand corner of the console. Here, you will find two fields to fill in; the first being the username (nfadmin), followed by the ssh key field where the user will enter the contents of their public ssh key. Once the fields are populated properly, select \"update\". Once you are logged in to the gateway, run these commands to register it to your NetFoundry Network. Look for errors in the registration process output, or \"Success\" if registration completes successfully.

Terraform and Python3 installed in path. Additional Information: The new Resource Group in Azure is created based on then name provided in Resource yaml , if one does not exists already in the same region (e.g. centralus). The action delete gateway will delete the RG as well even if it was an existing RG. If one does not want to delete the RG, the command terraform state rm \"{tf resource name for RG}\" needs to be run before running the gateway delete step. This will ensure that the RG is not deleted. A new vNet will be created and NF Gateway will be placed in it. Environment means the NF Console Environment used (e.g. production), not Azure. Steps Clone this repo (git clone https://github.com/netfoundry/mop.git) Update Resource yaml file with the desired options to feed into the wrapper script as described in the following code snippet.

SSH instance level key : (OPTIONAL)If you would like to apply an instance level ssh key. Block project wide ssh keys : (OPTIONAL) If you would like to prevent the project keys from being applied to this instance. Network name / Subnet name : The network you would like to place your appliance in. Firewall : (OPTIONAL) If you would like to allow ssh access to your instance, please check the box & fill out the restricted source ip/networks. We do not recommend leaving this open to 0.0.0.0/0 if you choose this option. IP forwarding : Must be set to on, if you would like to reach applications within your networks. GatewayRegistrationKey : (OPTIONAL) This field allows you provide the gateway registration key that will passed into the launching image. Automating the registration portion of the setup. You can access the gateway via ssh & register after this deployment is complete. Learn how to get a registration key here . Once the fields have been supplied, Click on \"Deploy\" Post Deployment @ If you did not supply the GatewayRegistrationKey field during the deployment, you can access the machine via ssh by Clicking on the \"SSH\" button.
