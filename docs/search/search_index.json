Once the download is complete, the image can now be used by the local user. 2 Setup a VCPE Gateway on the Azure stack @ 2.1 Create an Azure Stack Gateway in the NetFoundry Console @ Sign in to your NetFoundry organization; Navigate to the Gateways page and create a new Azure Stack gateway. Give it a name and location, then click the Create button; Take note of the registration key. You will need it to register the gateway later. 2.2 Launch a NetFoundry Gateway Instance Inside of Your Azure Stack @ Sign in to your account on the Azure portal and go to \u2192 Resource groups. Once inside the resource group, Click the \"+ Add\" button on the toolbar. Search for \" Application Connection Gateway (Azure Stack)\". Click on the result, the description should be shown. Click the \"Create\" button to launch the wizard. Enter basics information: Enter the Username as \"nfadmin\". Important The username must be nfadmin to gain access to this gateway; ( the username restriction will be removed soon ) Click OK to continue Next page, on choosing the compute size, it varies depends on your need. We are using a 2 VCPUs and 4 GB RAM for this example. Continue to finish setup and let system bring up the VM. 2.3 Register the gateway with your NetFoundry Network @ Once the resource is created, go to the resource group & click on the virtual machine name to view the details. Locate the machine's public IP address. Using an SSH client, log in to the machine using its public IP address as the user \"nfadmin\", using the SSH key or password specified earlier. > ssh -i [path/to/private/key] nfadmin@[public_ip_address] What to do if you cannot login to the VM? It has been discovered that when using some version of Azure Stack (i.e. 1.1908.0.20) that after launching the VM, the user must reset the SSH key via the Azure console. This is accomplished by selecting the newly created VM and clicking \"reset password\" in the bottom left hand corner of the console. Here, you will find two fields to fill in; the first being the username (nfadmin), followed by the ssh key field where the user will enter the contents of their public ssh key. Once the fields are populated properly, select \"update\". Once you are logged in to the gateway, run these commands to register it to your NetFoundry Network. Look for errors in the registration process output, or \"Success\" if registration completes successfully. [registration key] is the key you captured earlier. > sudo nfnreg [registration key] > sudo systemctl status dvn.service The output should report ACTIVE . Most common causes for registration to fail are: Not having an IP assigned (correctly), Not having a working default gateway for Internet access, Not having a valid DNS resolver. It may take up to 5 minutes to register and come online. Once the Gateway Instance has started up, switch back to the NetFoundry Console and locate the Gateway Endpoint. Confirm that the status indicator is green, which means that it has successfully registered and is online. If the status indicator remains grey, then the gateway has failed to register. If it is red, the gateway has registered, but is offline. 3 Create Service to Reach the server @ Here is an example on how to reach the server on the Azure stack side by using the AppWan provisioning on the NetFoundry Console.

Terraform and Python3 installed in path. Additional Information: The new Resource Group in Azure is created based on then name provided in Resource yml , if one does not exist already in the same region (e.g. centralus). The action delete gateway will delete the RG as well even if it was an existing RG. If one does not want to delete the RG, the command terraform state rm \"{tf resource name for RG}\" needs to be run before running the gateway delete step. This will ensure that the RG is not deleted. A new vNet will be created and NF Gateway will be placed in it. Environment means the NF Console Environment used (e.g. production), not Azure. Steps Clone this repo (git clone https://github.com/netfoundry/mop.git) Update Resource yaml file with the desired options to feed into the wrapper script as described in the following code snippet. All Resource.yml Options Run this from the root folder to create GW in NF Console UI and Azure. python3 quickstarts / docs / api / python / source / netfoundry / nf_resources . py -- file quickstarts / docs / api / python / etc / nf_resources . yml Required Configuration Parameters for Gateway Creation environment : production network_action : get network_name : DemoNet01 gateway_list : - action : create cloud : azure count : 1 names : [] region : westus regionalCidr : [ 10.20.10.0/24 ] regkeys : [] resourceGroup : name : demoPythonTerraform01 region : centralus tag : TerraformDemo terraform : bin : terraform output : 'no' source : ./quickstarts/docs/terraform work_dir : . After the script is run successfully, one can see that the gateway name and registration key were saved in Resource.yml file.

The services that will be optimized are share-point and one-drive Microsoft deployed content delivery network (CDN), where they offer many entry points around the World to access Office 365 Services like sharepoint, onedrive, etc. By providing these \"front doors\" (also known as) to O365 services, MS wanted to improve user experience by optimizing reach-ability and access. With that in mind, Microsoft is pushing Enterprises to utilize this CDN by creating O365 bypass at the edge of the Enterprise Network. The bypass is a configuration change, where a policy routing is enforced to allow the 0365 services to be short circuited to the Internet. The idea is to avoid going through a central location, where all content is inspected and checked for security threats before released to World Wide Web. NetFoundry Edge has the ability to provide such bypass if desired, but in this Quickstart we are showing how our customers can configure NF Network to complement the MS CDN, utilize their optimization and still keep using NF Secure tunnels for connectivity. Find the Closest Front Door @ Microsoft created an online tool to test from user's location, where the best entry to their Network is. Please open a browser on your windows computer and type the following url https://connectivity.office.com/. As it is stated there, click on the location icon. Once the test is finished, it will show where the closest location is. In our example, the user's closest location is Ashburn, VA (Azure USEAST). Select Region Make sure you replace \"Your Region\" with the location of Azure DC given by the location tool. Most of the time, our Orchestration Platform will optimize the network to provide direct connectivity from where you are and Azure GW you are about to create. We will test if that is the case. We continuously update our optimization algorithm to pick the best path all the time based on ongoing data collection and feedback from the network fabric.

The services that will be optimized are share-point and one-drive Microsoft deployed content delivery network (CDN), where they offer many entry points around the World to access Office 365 Services like sharepoint, onedrive, etc. By providing these \"front doors\" (also known as) to O365 services, MS wanted to improve user experience by optimizing reach-ability and access. With that in mind, Microsoft is pushing Enterprises to utilize this CDN by creating O365 bypass at the edge of the Enterprise Network. The bypass is a configuration change, where a policy routing is enforced to allow the 0365 services to be short circuited to the Internet. The idea is to avoid going through a central location, where all content is inspected and checked for security threats before released to World Wide Web. NetFoundry Edge has the ability to provide such bypass if desired, but in this Quickstart we are showing how our customers can configure NF Network to complement the MS CDN, utilize their optimization and still keep using NF Secure tunnels for connectivity.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"cloud/azure/o365-optimization/#find_the_closest_front_door","text":"Microsoft created an online tool to test from user's location, where the best entry to their Network is.

Run the automation script from the automation VM to setup the CPE box This guide will not cover @ This guide will only cover deployment of OVA with VMWare6.7, it will not cover all hypervisor out there. However, the provided OVA will work with VM Workstation 12 or EXSi 6.5 or later and VirtualBox. This guide will not cover how to setup installation media of Cent7 OS. At the end of guide, it will describe where to find the OS image and some tools. 2. Create Automation VM @ Note This procedure only needs to execute once for all CPE boxes. It is recommended to create this VM using VMWare hypervisor. Obtain the CPE-Automation OVA @ Todo We will need to put the OVA somewhere customer can download. Create the VM with the OVA @ From your hypervisor, create a VM and use the Deploy from OVA option Hit \" Next \", and you can choose your OVA image and give a name to the VM you are creating Hit \" Next \", it will ask you which storage (Disk) you want to put your VM. Choose one that suits you. Hit \" Next \u201c and choose your Network. (Hint, \"VM Network\" is your default network, that usually is a good choice). For \"Disk provisioning\", you can leave it at the default choice of \"Thin\". Hit \" Next \", and you are ready to deploy the OVA. Review the content carefully and hit \" Finish \" to deploy it. After you hit \" Finish \", on the Task window, you should notice the VM been created. Once the it reaches 100%, your VM is created. And it should automatically start after the deployment is done. Login and Check the automation VM @ Once the VM is completely deployed, we need to make sure the VM is setup correctly. Go to the main VM window, right click on your VM, on the popup menu, choose \" Console \"->\" Open browser console \". You will see a console window pop up like this: Login to the console by using credential Username: nfadmin Password: nfadmin Check the IP setting by issuing \" ip a \" command. If you see a valid IP address, then your VM is on a network. You can verify ssh access to the VM by using a ssh enabled terminal: > ssh nfadmin@[ip_address_of_the_automation_vm] Conclusion This is the end of deploying the automation VM. 3. Installing CentOS 7 on the CPE @ Note Have this ready before you start: You will need a CentOS 7 installation media before you start. Insert an Ethernet Cable into your CPE and bootup your CPE via the installation media, you will encounter the first screen: Choose \" Install CentOS 7 \" to continue. On the next screen, Choose your Language. And hit \" Continue \" The \" INSTALLATION SUMMARY \" screen will appear. Check to make sure the step (1) \" SOFTWARE SELECTION \" is set to \" Minimal Install \". Then Click on step (2) \" INSTALLATION DESTINATION \" to setup the Disk. Once in the \" INSTALLATION DESTINATION \" screen Choose your Disk (NOT the USB installation media) Click on \" Automatically configure partitioning \" Then hit \" Done \" at the top left screen to continue. Once you are back to the \"INSTALLATION SUMMARY\" screen Choose step (3) \"NETWORK & HOST NAME\". The following screen should appear. Turn on the Ethernet by hitting the button marked (1). And then observe the IP Address appears below it (at area Marked (2)). (We will need that IP address when we run the automation). Then hit \" Done \" at the top left screen to continue. You should be back to the \"INSTALLATION SUMAMRY\" screen again, and you can hit \" Begin Installation\" \" to start the Installation. During the installation, you need to create a user account. For our deployment, you do not need to create root Password. So, press on \" USER CREATION \" to create an Admin user. On the \" CREATE USER \" screen, you need to fill the following: Username: nfadmin click on \" Make this user administrator \" Password: nfadmin You then need to click \" Done \" twice to exit this screen. You will be sent back to the installation screen, wait for it to complete installation, and the \" Reboot \" button will appear for you to restart the CPE with the CentOS installed. Conclusion This is the end of installing CentOS 7 on the CPE box. 4. Run Automation to setup the CPE box @ Note You will need the IP address of your automation VM and the IP address of your CPE to continue this step Connect to your automation VM via ssh from a terminal > ssh nfadmin@[ip_address_of_the_automation_vm] Login to the VM by using password: nfadmin Start the automation by issuing the following command: > ./setup-nfnbox.bash [ip_address_of_cpe] The automation will prompt you to enter \" SSH password \" to login to the CPE box ( nfadmin ) \" BECOME password \" (hit <ENTER> key) The automation will take a few minutes to complete. At the end of automation, you will see message like this: PLAY RECAP ****************************************************************************************************************** 10.111.111.1 : ok=6 changed=3 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0 192.168.1.184 : ok=35 changed=28 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=2 rescued=0 ignored=0 Conclusion The CPE is now setup and ready. 5. CentOS 7 Installation Media @ Disclaimer There are many ways to obtain and setup the installation media. If you never set one up before, the quickest and easiest way to create one is by downloading the OS image and burn it to a USB by using disk utility. CentOS 7 image @ You can obtain a copy of OS image by visiting centos.org. But since you need to get a CentOS 7 image (not the latest CentOS 8), here is a quick link to Cent7OS mirror sites: http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/ Recommend download the \"CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-xxxx.iso\" (around 4.5G). This is the image tested. Since we use minimal installation from CentOS 7, so the minimal image should work also \"CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-xxxx.iso\" (around 1G) Burn Image to a USB stick @ You can burn the image to a USB stick by using Rufus (if you are on a PC).

The OS for this white box will be Ubuntu 20.04 1. Introduction @ We have not decided how to deliver our installation media to the customer yet. That will be determined later on based on the system integrator we pick. There are three approaches on how to deliver the image. Build a installation media with Cubic. Ship the installation media to the integrator. Create an ansible image for the integrator. Create a golden image for the integrator. 2. Cubic Approach @ 2.1 General info @ With the Cubic approach, the customer get a modified Ubuntu 20.04 installation image. This section is going to cover how to create that image. The image will not be CIS hardened. The CIS hardening script renders the installation image useless. The CIS hardening will need to be called via cloud-init after the installation, which makes the installation process much longer. So this approach is not desirable. 2.2 Obtain the installation media and create installation USB @ The Cubic requires GUI to run, so the installation ISO can be the desktop version of the Ubuntu20.04. But the installation ISO we going to create is based on the server version, so we going to cover the steps based on Ubuntu 20.04 server installation. This document is not going to cover how to create USB installation stick. 2.3 Install Ubuntu 20.04 server on Supermicro @ Before your installation starts, make sure you connect the ethernet cable to the first interface on the box. This will make setup the interface a little easier. Boot up the installation media and start the installation. Choose the default \"English\" language or choose your desired language. Choose \"Continue without updating\". Keep the default keyboard layout or choose your keyboard layout (for different language) On the Network interface page, if the interface is connected, you should see an IP address assigned automatically. If you need to assign a manual IP, you can do so now. Please write down the IP address, you will need that for the later steps. Skip the Proxy address if you don't use proxy. Keep the default Mirror address and continue Use the entire disk (the default) for installation. Hit continue to confirm the selection Choose your username and server name. Write down the username. We will need the username to login to the system to do future configuration. Enable \"Install OpenSSH server\" for remote access to the server. Skip the snaps selection and continue. Now system will go into installation and update of the security package. It will take few minutes to finish. When the installation completes, you can reboot the server. 2.4 Install GUI @ ssh into the box by using the IP address obtained above. Install the GUI and cubic ssh ziggy@192.168.1.63 ziggy@192.168.1.63's password: > sudo apt update > sudo apt install tasksel > sudo tasksel install ubuntu-desktop > sudo apt-add-repository ppa:cubic-wizard/release > sudo apt install cubic Restart the box and login from the graphic terminal. > sudo shutdown -r 0 2.5 Generate custom installer using Cubic @ Copy Ubuntu 20.04 server image (ISO) into the box. If you have the image already, you can simply scp into the box. Or you can download it again into your box by using firefox browser. > scp ubuntu-20.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso ziggy@192.168.1.63: ziggy@192.168.1.63's password: ubuntu-20.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso 100% 914MB 96.2MB/s 00:09 Copy setup ansible playbook to the box. > scp supermicro_playbook.tgz ziggy@192.168.1.63: ziggy@192.168.1.63's password: supermicro_playbook.tgz 100% 147KB 24.4MB/s 00:00 Start the Cubic on the desktop. Create a directory (cubic1) to save the custom image Choose the Ubuntu 20.04 server image. (Rest of the fields will fill themselves) Once the image is decompressed, you will see a \"Custom Ubuntu ISO Creator\" window. Copy the supermicro ansible tarball into the that window. then do the following commands: > sudo apt install ansible > tar xf supermicro_playbook.tgz > cd supermicro_playbook > ansible-playbook -i hostfile ubbox.yml Once the ansible successfully ran (if it is not successful, you can rerun it again), you can delete the playbook. > cd > rm -rf supermicro_playbook > rm -rf supermicro_playbook.tgz Hit Next on Cubic window and generate the installation image. 3 Create Ansible playbook for integrator @ Follow section 2.3 to install Ubuntu 20.04 on the system. Then copy the ansible playbook to the system. > scp supermicro_playbook.tgz ziggy@192.168.1.63: Login to the system. > ssh ziggy@192.168.1.63 Perform the following command to run the playbook. > tar xf supermicro_playbook.tgz > mkdir supermicro_playbook > cd supermicro_playbook > tar xf ../supermicro_playbook.tgz > sudo apt install ansible > sudo su > ansible-playbook -i hostfile image-build.yml Note If the default username (ziggy) changes, we will need to update the ansible-playbook accordingly. 4 Create an golden image for the integrator @ Follow steps in section 3 to setup the box. Use a live CD (for example Fedora LiveCD) to bootup the system. This ensures the Ubuntu 20.04 installation disk is not the running disk of the OS. We also need another USB stick to save the image (the live CD most likely will have a READ only system). After boot up the system with the live CD, open a terminal windows and check what disks are on the system. $ lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT sda 8:0 1 14.5G 0 disk \u2514\u2500sda1 8:1 1 14.5G 0 part /run/initramfs/live sdb 8:16 1 28.9G 0 disk \u2514\u2500sdb1 8:17 1 28.9G 0 part /run/media/liveuser/ADATA UFD loop0 7:0 0 12K 1 loop loop1 7:1 0 1.8M 1 loop \u2514\u2500live-osimg-min 253:3 0 6G 1 dm loop2 7:2 0 1.3G 1 loop loop3 7:3 0 6G 1 loop \u251c\u2500live-rw 253:1 0 6G 0 dm / \u251c\u2500live-base 253:2 0 6G 1 dm \u2514\u2500live-osimg-min 253:3 0 6G 1 dm loop4 7:4 0 512M 0 loop \u2514\u2500live-rw 253:1 0 6G 0 dm / nvme0n1 259:0 0 238.5G 0 disk \u251c\u2500nvme0n1p1 259:1 0 512M 0 part \u251c\u2500nvme0n1p2 259:2 0 1G 0 part \u2514\u2500nvme0n1p3 259:3 0 237G 0 part \u2514\u2500ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 253:0 0 118.5G 0 lvm As you can see, the \"sda1\" is the liveCD. \"sdb1\" is the USB disk for image.
